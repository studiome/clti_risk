# Overview 

 Risk Calculator for  two year overall survival (OS) and amputation free survival (AFS) after revascularisation in patients with chronic limb threatening ischaemia


## Prediction model

- This project is based [Miyata T. et al, Prediction Models for Two Year Overall Survival and Amputation Free Survival After Revascularisation for Chronic Limb Threatening Ischaemia. Eur J Vasc Endovasc Surg
. 2022 Jun 7;S1078-5884(22)00340-9](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejvs.2022.05.038).

- This app calculates 2 year OS and AFS after revascularization in CLTI patiens. 
- You get these risks if you enter the patient's value as indicated.
